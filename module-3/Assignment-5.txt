Database Design

Objective: To practice designing a database schema.

Task:

In this assignment, you will apply your database design skills by creating a database schema for a specific scenario. Imagine you are tasked with designing a database for an online bookstore. Your goal is to create an appropriate database schema that includes tables, relationships, and primary keys.

Scenario: Online Bookstore Database

Your task is to design a database for an online bookstore. The database should store information about books, authors, customers, orders, and categories. Here are the main entities and attributes to consider:

Books:

ISBN (Primary Key)
Title
Author (Foreign Key)
Price
Publication Year
Category (Foreign Key)
Authors:

AuthorID (Primary Key)
Author Name
Customers:

CustomerID (Primary Key)
First Name
Last Name
Email
Address
Phone Number
Orders:

OrderID (Primary Key)
Customer (Foreign Key)
Order Date
Order Details:

OrderDetailID (Primary Key)
Order (Foreign Key)
Book (Foreign Key)
Quantity
Total Price
Categories:

CategoryID (Primary Key)
Category Name
Assignment Requirements:

Design the database schema for the Online Bookstore scenario by creating the necessary tables. Ensure you establish appropriate relationships between tables using foreign keys.

Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visually represents the relationships between the tables.

Provide a brief description of your schema design choices. Explain why you chose to structure the database in a particular way and how it meets the requirements of the scenario.

Submission:

Submit the following items as part of your assignment:

An ERD diagram that clearly shows the tables, their attributes, and the relationships between them. You can use ERD drawing software or tools for this purpose.

A text document (PDF or Word) that includes a description of your schema design choices. Explain why you structured the database in a certain manner and how it fulfills the needs of the online bookstore scenario.

Example Submission (partial):

ERD Diagram:

[Include an image or diagram of your ERD here.]

Schema Design Choices:

In designing the database for the online bookstore, I made several key decisions:

I created separate tables for "Books," "Authors," "Customers," "Orders," "Order Details," and "Categories" to maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.
I used foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. For example, the "Books" table has a foreign key to link to the "Authors" and "Categories" tables, ensuring that each book is associated with the correct author and category.

Accuracy and completeness of the database schema, including the use of primary keys and foreign keys.
Clarity and correctness of the ERD diagram.
Depth and rationale provided in the description of schema design choices.
Adherence to good database design principles.
