Setting Up a MySQL Database

Objective: To practice creating a MySQL database and tables.

Task:

In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up a MySQL database and designing a schema for a simple web application. Follow the steps below:

Database Setup:

Install MySQL locally on your computer if you haven't already. You can also use an online MySQL service.
Create a new database named "webappdb".
Table Design:

Design a schema for a simple web application that includes the following tables:
Users: This table should store information about registered users, including fields like user ID, username, email, and password.
Products: This table should store information about products available in the web application, such as product ID, name, description, price, and stock quantity.
Orders: This table should track user orders, including order ID, user ID (foreign key referencing the Users table), product ID (foreign key referencing the Products table), order date, and quantity.
SQL Scripts:

Write SQL scripts to create the "webappdb" database and the above-mentioned tables with appropriate data types and constraints. Ensure that you define primary keys, foreign keys, and any other necessary constraints.
Submission:

Submit the SQL scripts you created for database creation and table schemas. You can include comments in your scripts to explain the purpose of each SQL statement.
Example Submission (partial):


-- SQL script to create the 'webappdb' database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS webappdb;

-- Use the 'webappdb' database
USE webappdb;

-- SQL script to create the 'Users' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (
    UserID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- SQL script to create the 'Products' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Products (
    ProductID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description TEXT,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    StockQuantity INT NOT NULL
);

-- SQL script to create the 'Orders' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Orders (
    OrderID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    Quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);


Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Successful creation of the "webappdb" database.
Accurate and well-designed table schemas for Users, Products, and Orders.
Proper use of primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and constraints in the SQL scripts.
Clarity and organization of your SQL scripts.
