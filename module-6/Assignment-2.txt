Creating a Content Management System (CMS) - Part 2

Objective: To complete the CMS functionality and enhance user content management.

Task:

In this assignment, you will continue developing the PHP-based CMS from Assignment 1. Your goal is to extend the CMS by adding essential features such as content editing, content deletion, and listing all available content. Emphasize user-friendly interfaces for content management.

Implement a user interface that allows administrators to edit existing content items.
Ensure that only administrators can access the edit functionality.
Delete Content:

Create a mechanism for administrators to delete content items.
Include confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions.
List All Content:

Develop a dedicated page where all available content items are listed.
Include sorting options (e.g., by date, title) to make content discovery easier.
User Experience Enhancements:

Improve the overall user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the CMS.
Ensure that administrators can intuitively manage content, navigate the CMS, and receive clear feedback.
Security Considerations:

Enhance security by implementing proper validation and escaping of user inputs.
Ensure that only authenticated administrators can perform content management actions.
Testing:

Thoroughly test the CMS to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
Verify that all features work as expected.
