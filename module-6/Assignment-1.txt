Creating a Content Management System (CMS) - Part 1

Objective: To begin building a basic Content Management System (CMS) using PHP.

Task:

In this assignment, you will start developing a PHP-based CMS that allows administrators to log in, create, and view content. The objective is to implement user authentication, content creation, and basic database interactions for storing content data.

Instructions:

Set Up Your Development Environment:

Ensure that you have a working PHP development environment (as set up in previous assignments).
Set up a MySQL database to store user and content data.
User Authentication:

Create a user authentication system that includes user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
Administrators should have access to the CMS, so create an "admin" role or permission level.
Database Schema:

Design a database schema that includes tables for users and content.
The "users" table should store user information, including username, email, and hashed passwords.
The "content" table should store content items, including a title, body, publication date, and author (user ID).
Content Management:

Implement a user interface for administrators to create new content items.
Develop a page that lists all content items with their titles, publication dates, and authors.
Database Interactions:

Use PHP and MySQL to interact with the database for user registration, login, and content management.
Ensure that only authenticated administrators can access the content management features.
User Experience:

Design a user-friendly interface for the CMS with proper navigation, forms, and error handling.
Implement user-friendly URLs for content items (e.g., "cms/view/1" for the first content item).
Submission:

Submit the following for this assignment:

The PHP files and scripts for your CMS (Part 1).
A brief document or email confirming the successful completion of Part 1.
Example Submission (partial):
