Building a Blogging Platform - Part 1 (Optional)

Objective: To start building a blogging platform.

Task:

For this optional project, you will begin the development of a blogging platform. In Part 1, you will focus on setting up the foundational components, including designing the database schema and creating the basic structure for adding, editing, and deleting blog articles. You can also implement user registration and login to prepare for user-specific content.

Instructions:

Database Design:

Design the database schema for your blogging platform. Consider tables for storing blog articles, user information, comments, and any other necessary data.
Define the relationships between different tables (e.g., one-to-many between users and articles, and between articles and comments).
User Registration and Login:

Implement user registration and login functionality if you haven't already done so in previous assignments.
Ensure that user registration includes fields like username, email, and password.
Article Management:

Create a user interface for adding, editing, and deleting blog articles.
Implement validation to ensure that articles have required fields (e.g., title, content) and display helpful error messages when needed.
Articles should be associated with the user who created them.
Testing:

Thoroughly test the article management features and user registration/login.
Ensure that data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

Submit the following for this optional assignment:

The SQL script containing your database schema design.
