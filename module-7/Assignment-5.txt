API Integration (Optional)

Objective: To integrate and interact with a RESTful API.

Task:

In this optional assignment, you have the opportunity to build a separate application that consumes the RESTful API created in Assignment 4. This assignment focuses on how to send HTTP requests to an API, handle responses, and utilize the API's functionality within your application.

Instructions:

Choose Your Application:

You can create a new application for this assignment or extend one of your previous assignments.
API Integration:

Integrate the API you developed in Assignment 4 into your application.
Implement features in your application that utilize the API's functionality. For example, if your API provides blog post retrieval, integrate it into a blog website to display posts fetched from the API.
Ensure proper authentication and authorization if your API requires it.
User Interface (UI):

Create a user-friendly interface for your application. This may involve designing web pages, forms, or interactive components that interact with the API.
Testing:

Test your application thoroughly to ensure that API integration works as expected.
Test different scenarios, such as creating new data through the API, updating existing data, and deleting data.
Documentation:

Provide documentation within your application or as a separate document that explains how users can interact with the integrated API features.
Submission:

Submit the following for this optional assignment:

All PHP files and scripts related to your application.
Documentation within your application or as a separate document explaining how users can use the integrated API features.
