Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Objective: To introduce role-based access control (RBAC) concepts.

Task:

In this assignment, you will build upon your existing user authentication system and enhance it by implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC allows you to control access to various parts of your application based on user roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) and permissions.

Instructions:

Define Roles and Permissions:

Define different roles for your application (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
Determine the permissions associated with each role. For example, an admin might have full access, while an editor can edit content but not delete it, and a viewer can only read content.
Database Modifications:

Modify your user database schema to include a field for user roles. You may need to update your registration process to assign roles during user creation.
Create a new table or structure to store role-permission mappings.
Access Control Logic:

Implement access control logic throughout your application. This includes controlling access to specific pages, functions, or features based on the user's role and permissions.
Create PHP functions or methods that check whether a user has the required permissions to perform certain actions.
User Interface Changes:

Update your application's user interface to reflect the user's role and permissions. For example, display different menu options or buttons based on the user's role.
Testing:

Test the RBAC implementation with different user roles to ensure that access control works as expected.
Verify that users can only perform actions allowed by their assigned roles and permissions.
Submission:

Submit the following for this assignment:

PHP files and scripts related to RBAC implementation.
A brief document or email confirming the successful implementation of RBAC, including a description of roles and permissions.

Assignment 3: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- I have successfully implemented RBAC for our user authentication system.
- Roles (admin, editor, viewer) have been defined with appropriate permissions.
- Access control logic is in place to restrict user actions based on their roles.
- The user interface has been updated to reflect role-based access.

Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of RBAC with clearly defined roles and permissions.
Proper access control logic that prevents unauthorized actions.
User interface updates that reflect role-based access.
Thorough testing to ensure RBAC works as expected for different roles and permissions.
