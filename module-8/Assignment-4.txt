Set Up the Framework:

Install and set up the chosen PHP framework on your local development environment. Follow the framework's documentation and best practices.
Project Development:

Begin developing your chosen project using the framework. Leverage the framework's features and tools to streamline the development process.
Focus on implementing essential functionalities of your project. For instance, if you're building a task management system, ensure users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
Framework Features:

Highlight the key features of the framework that simplify development. These may include routing, database migrations, authentication, and templating.
Database Integration:

Integrate a database (e.g., MySQL) with your project using the framework's database capabilities.
Testing:

Test your project thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Documentation:

Create documentation that explains how to set up and run your project. Include instructions for any specific commands or configurations required for the chosen framework.
