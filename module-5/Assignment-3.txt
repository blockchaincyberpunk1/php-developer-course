Building a Contact Form

Objective: To create a functional contact form using PHP for a website.

Task:

In this assignment, you will be tasked with building a contact form for a website. The contact form should allow users to send messages to a specified recipient. You will need to develop a PHP script that handles form submissions, validates user input, and sends an email notification.

Instructions:

Set Up Your Development Environment:

Ensure that you have a working PHP development environment (as set up in previous assignments).
Create the Contact Form:

Design an HTML contact form that includes fields for the user to input their name, email address, subject, message, and possibly other relevant information.
Implement form validation to ensure that the required fields are filled out correctly.
Use HTML and CSS to style the form appropriately.
Develop the PHP Script:

Create a PHP script that handles the form submission.
Validate the user's input, checking for proper email format and ensuring that all required fields are filled out.
Implement error handling to provide clear feedback to users in case of validation errors.
Sending Email:

Utilize PHP's mail() function or a library like PHPMailer to send an email with the form data to a specified recipient (e.g., an email address).
Include the user's name, email, subject, and message in the email body.
Success Message:

After successfully sending the email, display a confirmation message to the user on the web page.
Optionally, you can also include a "Thank you" page or redirect the user to a different URL after submission.
Testing:

Test your contact form thoroughly by filling out the form with valid and invalid inputs.
Ensure that the form validation and email sending functionalities work as expected.

Submit the following for this assignment:

The PHP script for handling the contact form.
The HTML file containing the contact form.
A brief document or email confirming the successful completion of the assignment.
