Building a Blogging Platform (Optional)

Objective: To develop a basic blogging platform using PHP.

Task:

In this optional assignment, you have the opportunity to create a simple blogging platform from scratch using PHP. The goal is to build a platform that allows users to perform various actions related to blog posts, such as creating, editing, and deleting posts. Users should also be able to view a list of blog posts and click on individual posts to read them.

Instructions:

Set Up Your Development Environment:

Ensure that you have a working PHP development environment (as set up in previous assignments).
Set up a MySQL database to store blog post data.
User Authentication (Optional):

If you haven't implemented user authentication in a previous assignment, consider adding it to this project. Users should be able to register, log in, and log out of the blogging platform.
Blog Post Features:

Create a user-friendly interface for performing the following actions:
Create Post: Allow users to create new blog posts. The post should include a title, content, and a publication date.
Edit Post: Implement an editing feature that lets users update existing blog posts.
Delete Post: Allow users to delete their own posts.
List Posts: Create a page that lists all the blog posts with their titles and publication dates.
Read Post: Develop a feature that allows users to click on a post's title to view the full content.
Database Integration:

Use PHP and MySQL to interact with the database. You should create tables for users and blog posts.
Ensure that users can only edit or delete their own posts.
User Experience (Optional):

Enhance the user experience with proper navigation, forms, and error handling.
Implement user-friendly URLs for blog posts (e.g., "blog/post-title").
Testing:

Thoroughly test your blogging platform to ensure that all features work correctly. Check for any potential issues or bugs.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to use your blogging platform, including instructions for registering, creating posts, and editing/deleting posts.
Submission:

Submit the following for this optional assignment:

The PHP files and scripts for your blogging platform.
A brief document or email confirming the successful completion of the assignment.
