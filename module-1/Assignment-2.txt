HTML Forms and User Input

Objective: To understand HTML forms and user input handling.

Task: In this assignment, you will design an HTML form that collects user information, including name, email, and feedback. You will use various form elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button. Additionally, you will implement basic form validation using HTML attributes.

Instructions:

Create a New HTML Document:

Open your preferred text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Create a new file and save it with the .html extension (e.g., user_feedback.html).
HTML Structure:

Begin by defining the basic structure of an HTML document using the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
Create the HTML <html> element that encloses the entire page.
Inside the <html> element, include the <head> and <body> elements.
Page Title:

Within the <head> section, set the title of your web page using the <title> element (e.g., "User Feedback Form").
Form Creation:

Inside the <body> section, create an HTML <form> element.
Use various form elements to collect the following user information:
Name: <input> element with type="text"
Email: <input> element with type="email"
Gender (radio buttons): <input> elements with type="radio"
Feedback (text area): <textarea> element
Interests (checkboxes): <input> elements with type="checkbox"
Submit Button: <input> element with type="submit"
Form Validation:

Implement basic form validation using HTML attributes (e.g., required, pattern, minlength, maxlength) to ensure that users provide valid input.
For example, the email input can use the type="email" attribute to enforce valid email addresses.
Submit Action:

Specify the action to be taken when the user submits the form using the action attribute. You can use a placeholder value like action="#" for this assignment.
Method:

Set the HTTP method to POST using the method attribute.
View in Browser:

Open your HTML file in a web browser to test the form and ensure that form validation works as expected.
Submission:

Save your HTML file after making any final adjustments.
Submit the HTML file that contains your user feedback form.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct HTML structure, including the use of essential HTML elements.
Inclusion of all required form elements (name, email, gender, feedback, interests, and submit button).
Proper form validation using HTML attributes.
Accuracy of the displayed form in the browser.
Properly named and submitted HTML file with the .html extension.
