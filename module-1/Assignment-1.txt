Basic HTML Page Creation

Objective: To practice creating a simple HTML web page.

Task: In this assignment, you will create a basic HTML web page using a text editor. The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the fundamental structure of HTML and introduce you to basic HTML elements and styling using CSS.

Instructions:

Create a New HTML Document:

Open your preferred text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Create a new file and save it with the .html extension (e.g., index.html).
HTML Structure:

Begin by defining the basic structure of an HTML document using the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
Create the HTML <html> element that encloses the entire page.
Inside the <html> element, include the <head> and <body> elements.
Page Title:

Within the <head> section, set the title of your web page using the <title> element. Choose a title relevant to your page content.
Heading and Content:

Inside the <body> section, add an <h1> element with a title for your web page (e.g., "My First Web Page").
Include several paragraphs of text using the <p> element. You can write about any topic you like.
Lists:

Create an unordered list (<ul>) with at least three list items (<li>). This can be a list of your favorite hobbies, movies, or any topic you prefer.
Additionally, create an ordered list (<ol>) with at least three list items.
Links:

Insert a hyperlink using the <a> element. Link to a website of your choice (e.g., your favorite blog, a news website).
Make sure the link opens in a new tab or window using the target="_blank" attribute.
Images:

Include an image on your web page using the <img> element. You can use any image you have or find one online.
Use the src attribute to specify the image file's path and the alt attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.
CSS Styling:

Add inline CSS styles to at least two elements on your web page (e.g., change text color, font size, or background color).
Additionally, include an internal CSS <style> block within the <head> section to apply styling to specific HTML elements.
View in Browser:

Open your HTML file in a web browser to ensure that it displays correctly.
Submission:

Save your HTML file after making any final adjustments.
Submit the HTML file you created.
